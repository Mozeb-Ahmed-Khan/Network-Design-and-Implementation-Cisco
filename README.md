# Network Design and Implementation with VLSM, DHCP, VLANs, Routing Protocols, and NAT

## Project Overview

In this semester project, we designed and implemented a comprehensive network using Cisco Packet Tracer. Our focus was on creating a scalable and efficient network infrastructure by leveraging various networking concepts and tools.

### Key Components:
- **IP Subnetting with VLSM**: We utilized Variable Length Subnet Masking (VLSM) to manage and optimize IP addressing across the organization.
- **Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)**: Implemented DHCP for automatic IP address assignment to simplify network management.
- **Routing Protocols**: Configured scalable routing protocols, including RIP (Routing Information Protocol), OSPF (Open Shortest Path First), and IGRP (Interior Gateway Routing Protocol).
- **Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs)**: Managed network resources by segmenting the network into VLANs for better organization and security.
- **Network Address Translation (NAT)**: Set up NAT to enable IP address translation and improve network security.
- **DNS and Web Servers**: Implemented Domain Name System (DNS) and web servers for network services.
- **Inter-VLAN Communication**: Established communication between different VLANs to ensure connectivity across the network.

### Skills Learned:
- **Subnetting Using VLSM**: Acquired skills in creating and managing subnets efficiently.
- **DHCP Configuration**: Gained practical experience in configuring DHCP for dynamic IP assignment.
- **Routing Protocols**: Implemented RIP, OSPF, and IGRP for scalable and efficient routing.
- **VLAN Management**: Learned to manage network resources through VLANs.
- **NAT Implementation**: Applied NAT for IP address translation and network security.
- **Inter-VLAN Communication**: Set up communication between VLANs to ensure network integration.
- **DNS and Web Servers**: Configured DNS and web servers to provide network services.
- **Cisco Packet Tracer**: Used Cisco Packet Tracer for network simulation and modeling.

## Project Files

- **Network Design File**: The main Cisco Packet Tracer file with the network design and configuration.
- **Documentation**: Includes all relevant documents, reports, and diagrams related to the network design and implementation.
- **Scripts**: Any scripts or configurations used for the project.
